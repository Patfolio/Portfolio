              <p><img src="dist/pictures/Natalie_Portrait_Final.jpg" class="image" >Natalie is responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the property and stables at Deer Ridge. She joined the Deer Ridge team in 2010 after choosing to transition from the horse racing industry. Natalie spent 8 years as an Assistant trainer travelling extensively with top North American thoroughbred racing stables. Natalie's passion for horses started at the young age of 8, when she began taking lessons at a local stable in Niagara Falls, ON.  She spent her early years showing on the local hunter circuits and eventually moved up to the A circuit under the tutelage of Forest Hill Farm. Natalie mostly enjoyed taking thoroughbreds off of the racetrack and preparing them for a new career. Natalie believes that happy horses perform best. It is her goal to create a relaxed and fun environment where the horses can thrive and maintain their competitive edge.</p>
