              <h2>San D&#39;or Earns Top Results in Season Debut</h2><h3>Tuesday, May 6 2014</h3>
              <p>Deer Ridge&#39;s San D&#39;Or earns top results in the CDI Gold Coast Opener! On Saturday Megan and San D&#39;or earned a score of 69.649% against an experienced field of competitors. The pair competed in the Intermediare 1  the following day to a score of 70.263%. and were named small tour champions. Despite his young age, he demonstrates a superb disposition in coping with the electric atmosphere in the show ring. Since importing San D&#39;Or as a four-year-old from Holland, we have very pleased with the development of this talented horse and look forward to his continued progression through the FEI levels.</p>

              <h2>Clinic with Oded Shimoni</h2><h3>Tuesday, May 6 2014</h3>
              <p>Deer Ridge Equestrian was excited to welcome Oded Shimoni for a clinic this past week! Oded has represented Israel at the World Equestrian Games, has qualified for the Olympics, and has trained numerous horses to the Grand Prix level. His keen eye and assured approach provided valuable advice as Deer Ridge&#39;s talented string of horses progress through the FEI levels. This was a great prelude to the Canadian competition season and Deer Ridge would like to thank Oded for a wonderful clinic and all the riders who attended!</p>
